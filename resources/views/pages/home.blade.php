        <h3>Support</h3>
        <p>Open source development requires a significant amount of time and effort. Since I don't run ads on my projects nor do I collect & sell your data, I don't make any money from them. This is why your support matters so much, as it keeps me motivated and allows me to dedicate more time into these projects.</p><br>

        <p>If you like what I do, please consider sharing my projects around, <a href="https://ko-fi.com/tahoe" title="Visit my Ko-Fi page">donating</a>, or even just <a href="mailto:mail@tahoe.be" title="Send me an email">saying thank you</a>. ðŸ˜Š</p>
